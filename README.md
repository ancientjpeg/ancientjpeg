 - Hi, I'm Jackson! I'm a music producer and software engineer who specializes in DSP, graphics, and anything else low-level. I make music under the moniker jk.
 - Over the summer of 2020 I taught myself C++, and since then I've branched out into Python, HTML/CSS/JS, 
and Vue.js, with plans to learn React and/or Svelte. I host all the media files for my personal website and some small minecraft servers for friends on a local Linux machine that I set up myself.
 - Fundamentally I'd say my deepest joy in programming is getting low-level with C++ and especially C, which I can pretty confidently say is my favorite language.
 - Ultimately, I aim to develop audio plugins so  I can further customize and improve my musical workflow, although 
I'm also keen on other projects like user-friendly clientside tools for social media.
