 - Hi, I'm Jackson! I'm currently a music student at California Institute of the Arts who's recently begun exploring 
software development. I make music under the moniker jk.
 - Over the summer of 2020 I taught myself C++, and since then I've branched out into Python, HTML/CSS/JS, 
and React. I've recently begun gravitating back towards low-level languages like C/C++, especially as I delve into hosting
my own website and some small minecraft servers for friends on local machines. 
 - Ultimately, I aim to develop audio plugins so  I can further customize and improve my musical workflow, although 
I'm also keen on other projects like user-friendly clientside tools for social media. 
- If you're curious, you can check out my soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/jxstkidding !!! I'm also easiest to reach through twitter.
