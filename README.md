# Who Am I?
- I'm Jackson! I'm a music producer and software engineer who specializes in DSP. I make music under the moniker jk.
- Over the summer of 2020 I taught myself C++, and since then I've branched out into Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Golang
- My greatest love in programming is writing code that is extremely robust
   - Nothing makes me happier than code that can be formally verified by proof!
- Alongside developing unique audio plugins for my own use, I also use my personal projects explore algorithms that interest me and develop my skill in writing fault-tolerant networking and backend code.
- If you're curious, you can check out my soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/jxstkidding !
