 - Hi, I'm Jackson! I'm a music producer and software engineer who specializes in DSP. I make music under the moniker jk.
 - Over the summer of 2020 I taught myself C++, and since then I've branched out into Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Golang
 - My greatest love in programming is writing code that is extremely robust, and my favorite kind of code is code that can be formally verified through proof.
 - Alongside developing unique audio plugins for my own use, I also use my personal projects explore algorithms that interest me and develop my skill in writing fault-tolerant networking and backend code.
